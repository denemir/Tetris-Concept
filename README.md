# Tetris Concept
Playable Tetris Concept (unfinished)
## Description
This is a project from around late 2022 to early 2023, I didn't get too far into this one because it was more of a fun little side project.
You can do as much as stack blocks in this one, no rotating blocks, and I stopped in the middle of working on the drop shadow. No real "game" to it, just dropping blocks.
It was fun to work on this project for a little while on the side but other larger projects began.
## Usage
`TetrisMobile` > `TetrisMobile` >   `TetrisMobile` > `bin` > `x86` > `Debug` and then run `TetrisMobile.exe`.
